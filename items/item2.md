<h1> Group Maker Project 1 </h1>

<h3>What Was the Project?</h3>
<h5>The GMP1 project was a group project in which myself and 3 others worked together to redesign a box. The box was to try and use recycled materials and “hack” the box by changing its shape, configuration, or it’s purpose. Due to the COVID-19 restrictions, our group was unable to meet in person or physically create the box so we met in Zoom meetings and created a digital recreation to present to our classmates. The project concluded with a short slideshow presentation and an individual essay portion to reflect and go over our finished design and its process.</h5>
 
<h3>My Angle</h3>
<h5>This was one of the first design projects I had while being constrained by different lockdown regulations. This really forced me and my group to think outside the box and use new skills we may have not used before. A major part of most design projects is the ability to meet up, use whiteboards, and discuss ideas. Instead, we had to adapt to talking and working together through video conferencing apps like Zoom. While this was much more difficult to do, I think it was important because it allowed us to  create these skills that could be very useful in the field as I won;t always be able to meet people in person to work.</h5>
