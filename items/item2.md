<h3>What Was the Project?</h3>
<h5>The GMP1 project was a group project in which myself and 3 others worked together to redesign a box. The box was to try and use recycled materials and “hack” the box by changing its shape, configuration, or it’s purpose. Due to the COVID-19 restrictions, our group was unable to meet in person or physically create the box so we met in Zoom meetings and created a digital recreation to present to our classmates. The project concluded with a short slideshow presentation and an individual essay portion to reflect and go over our finished design and its process.</h5>
