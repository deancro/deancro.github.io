<h1> This Website Creation </h1>
<hr/>
<h3>What Was the Project?</h3>
<h5>This website was created throughout the semester for a variety of school assignments. With multiple modifications made, each assignment started by adding new pieces to it. Starting off just by changing and adding text, then by adding different colours and images, then a contact form, and then finally adding portfolio items. The website also underwent the addition of using heroku for the contact mailer, and then making sure that it passes accessability guidelines using axe plugin.</h5>
 
<h3>My Angle</h3>
<h5>The creation of this website was probably the most difficult project I have worked on so far in my UX program. Although seemingly very simple, I faced many challenges while working on it. Due to my complete lack of previous knowledge on any sort of coding I started off without any sort of groundwork. This meant that I needed to ask questions and ytrouble shoot more than I ever have before in my schooling. However, this struggle that I had has made me greatly improve my patience, problem solving, and even just my ability to ask good questions.</h5>
