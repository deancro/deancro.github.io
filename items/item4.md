<h1> This Website Creation </h1>

<h3>What Was the Project?</h3>
<h5>This website was created throughout the semester for a variety of school assignments. With multiple modifications made, each assignment started by adding new pieces to it. Starting off just by changing and adding text, then by adding different colours and images, then a contact form, and then finally adding portfolio items. The website also underwent the addition of using heroku for the contact mailer, and then making sure that it passes accessability guidelines using axe plugin.</h5>
