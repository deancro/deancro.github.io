<h1> Design Interventions </h1>
<hr/>
<h3>What Was the Project?</h3>
<h5>For the course UX-307 I created two individual design interventions and one synthesized design for a design problem. One of the design problems was finding a current design that inhibited diversity, and another was a design that inhibited inclusivity. The third design was one that combined aspects from each of my designs to create a finalized creation that can both help with diversity and inclusion.</h5>
 
<h3>My Angle</h3>
<h5>This was one of my first ever design attempts that I did as a User Experience Design student. This project allowed me to set a lot of the groundwork for my skills. The main takeaway I was able to get from working on this was the ability to take and implement feedback from others. I began with my a small report outlining the problems I saw with the original design and what I thought could be done to fix it. I then received some feedback from my prof on what sounded good and where I should explore further. I then took that and created a new design with labels on how it has been improved. Next, I received more feedback from the prof on possible improvements and clarifications, and implemented those ideas for a final design sketch.</h5>
