<h1> Design Interventions </h1>
<hr/>
<h3>What Was the Project?</h3>
<h5>For the course UX-307 I created two individual design interventions and one synthesized design for a design problem. One of the design problems was finding a current design that inhibited diversity, and another was a design that inhibited inclusivity. The third design was one that combined aspects from each of my designs to create a finalized creation that can both help with diversity and inclusion.</h5>
