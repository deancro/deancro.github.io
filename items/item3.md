<h1> Group Maker Project 2 </h1>

<h3>What Was the Project?</h3>
<h5>The GMP2 project was a continuation of the previous GMP assignment with the same group members. In this project, we used “critical making” to create a new design that helped address a social issue of concern. Our group decided on creating a portable homeless shelter with recycled tarps and umbrellas to try and assist in homelessness. Much like the first GMP project we first started with a project briefing to explain our idea and what we were going to do, followed by a slideshow presentation of our final design, and an individual essay to reflect our design process.</h5>
