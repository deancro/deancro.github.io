<h1> Group Maker Project 2 </h1>

<h3>What Was the Project?</h3>
<h5>The GMP2 project was a continuation of the previous GMP assignment with the same group members. In this project, we used “critical making” to create a new design that helped address a social issue of concern. Our group decided on creating a portable homeless shelter with recycled tarps and umbrellas to try and assist in homelessness. Much like the first GMP project we first started with a project briefing to explain our idea and what we were going to do, followed by a slideshow presentation of our final design, and an individual essay to reflect our design process.</h5>
 
<h3>My Angle</h3>
<h5>While creating this design we were encouraged heavily to think about the idea of critical making. A major concept from this was the idea that the acts of conversation, critical thinking, and interaction with others are more important and meaningful than the material project they create. This was very true when creating our design. We had to realize that with homelessness we weren't going to be able to completely solve the issue completely. Instead the biggest takeaway was the gained knowledge and understanding of the issue at hand. We were able to become better informed and aware of the problem sparking new ideas on how we can help.</h5>
