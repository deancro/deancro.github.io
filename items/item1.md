<h1> About Me </h1>
<hr/>
<h3>Who Am I?</h3>
<h5>I am a 19 year old User Experience Designer student at Wilfrid Laurier University. I am currently in my second year, and this portfolio was originally created for an assignment in Web Design.</h5>

<h3>What is this Website?</h3>
<h5>Right now it is just a bare bones display of my previous assignments and website creation skills. In the future I would like to continue to expand and try new skills with this site to improve its overall look and feel, as well as trying to add new features.</h5>
